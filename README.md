# Day Planner

## Description
A simple calendar app for scheduling your workday. This web page allows users to plan and manage their daily tasks during standard business hours (9am to 5pm). Users can add, edit, and save events for each hour of the workday. The application dynamically updates the HTML and uses color-coding to indicate past, present, and future time blocks. The user's input is saved in local storage, ensuring persistence even after the page is refreshed.
